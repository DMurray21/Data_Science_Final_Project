{"content": "A federal appeals court on Friday rejected a request by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to block President-elect Joe Biden from being declared the winner of the battleground state of Pennsylvania, dealing another significant setback to Trump\u2019s bid to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election.\n\n\"Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so,\" wrote Stephanos Bibas on behalf of a three-judge panel.\n\n\"Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here,\" he wrote Bibas, who was nominated by Trump. The case could still be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania Appeal Rejected in Scathing
