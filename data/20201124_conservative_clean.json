    "content": "CLARIFICATION: I DID NOT WRITE THIS, THIS WAS SIMPLY A COMMENT I FOUND IN ANOTHER THREAD\n\nBasic law here (well, I started it out that way....).\n\n1.\t\u2060Evidence is collected for a court to determine if a crime (or tort) has been committed. In this case, multiple crimes. Evidence is not a journalist writing an article, quoting  \"anonymous sources\". That is pure junk and pure opinion from one person.\n2.\t\u2060A court decides if the evidence presented satisfies the legal criteria the lawyers are complaining about (The Complaint) and want a resolution to/for the situation identified.\n3.\t\u2060Releasing names of witnesses is rarely done pre-trial. That's just insane unless the witness says it's ok. Most witnesses are afraid to testify in criminal proceedings. Why? They are often threatened and \"tampered\" with to change testimony.\n4.\t\u2060Listening to Giuliani...who brought down the mafia families in New York...there's a legal Hellstorm coming for Democrats.\n5.\t\u2060Why? One thing major comes to mind...Conspiracy charges. Giuliani hinted at it and it appears as if he's got information to show a court, there was coordination to commit fraud on the election, across multiple states.\n6.\t\u2060You don't give evidence directly to the public that is crucially sensitive to your case. Why?\n7.\t\u2060Jury. You might actually be a juror in this case, and if you got the \"facts\" from the media...you would be tainted. The facts MUST come purely and directly from the Complainants (i.e., Giuliani and his team) so you as a juror will not mix up fantasy article writing with what is presented. Conservative or Liberal media coverage...doesn't matter. If there is a special Grand Jury, you need a clear mind with pure facts in front of you to make the best decision.\n8.\t\u2060Some evidence has been revealed...the affidavits for example, and testimony excerpts. THAT IS EVIDENCE. Testimony from a Dominion employee and possibly other Dominion employees. THAT IS EVIDENCE.\n9.\t\u2060Giuliani and Powell et al, implied as much as they could without divulging too much...that they had documents of evidence connecting the crimes...not just affidavits. These will be discretely shown a Judge and the respective Defense Attorneys.\n10.\t\u2060Discovery. This is another reason why Giuliani wants to limit the amount of people who have access to his evidence, to legal professionals who hopefully will not leak information to the media such as names of witnesses and other findings which would give alleged criminals...time to cover their tracks (if they aren't doing it already).\n11.\t\u2060Powell referenced evidence seized in Germany but she said she didn't know if it was the good guys or bad guys that got it. This refers to rogue operatives in governments, US and Germany, who would destroy this evidence before honest government employees got a hold of it.\n12.\t\u2060The press conference lead by Giuliani was an announcement they will be going to court seeking remedies of removing bias and prejudice, and even criminal behavior...from the election pools all over this nation. The remedies sought, would be removing the tainted and fraudulent ballots and digital manipulations of ballot counts (fraudulent counts), effectively giving both candidates a more honest and realistic competitive outcome. How that outcome will be, should be rather indicative as Giuliani has hundreds of affidavits by individuals, where all testimony leads to one motive: The fraudulent capture of state ballots for a Democrat Presidential Candidate to appear as the winner.\n13.\t\u2060We've had these types of press conferences for decades. Sometimes you get actual elements of evidence to be presented in court like Giuliani and his team did today...but many times, attorneys are much much more vague at a press conference...UNTIL they get to court and appear before a Judge to hear them.",
